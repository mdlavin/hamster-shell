This project is based on 'hamster-in-the-shell' from Florent Th√©venet at https://gitorious.org/hamster-in-the-shell/hamster-in-the-shell.  I cloned his work and updated it to be useful enough for me.

Currently, you can monitor the current task and start new tasks.  Anything more complicted, you have to bring up the classic Hamster UI.

Javascript documentation is pretty hard to find, so here is some help:
    mozilla website for general js documentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference
    for St (shell toolkit) you'll have to find documentation in the code itself
    Use the shell debugging extension "Looking glass" (Alt + F2 then enter "lg" and press Enter), it can introspect js objects

Things that don't work:
    You can't enter an activity name, St entry refuses the " " when placed in a menu
    We miss a Hamster API to parse activities, open summary window...

To install copy the hamster@feuloren directory in ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/exensions and restart the shell (with Alt + F2 then enter "r" and press Enter).
