Ok guys, this is old code I wrote last year, so I guess it doesn't work anymore with a recent build of gnome-shell.

Things you can look at:
    map a dbus distant object to a local js object
    add a menu to gnome-shell panel

Javascript documentation is pretty hard to find, so here is some help:
    mozilla website for general js documentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference
    for St (shell toolkit) you'll have to find documentation in the code itself
    Use the shell debugging extension "Looking glass" (Alt + F2 then enter "lg" and press Enter), it can introspect js objects

Things that don't work:
    You can't enter an activity name, St entry refuses the " " when placed in a menu
    We miss a Hamster API to parse activities, open summary window...
